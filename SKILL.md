# Working-Class Voice

A methodology for writing authentically from below, capturing the perspective of people who work for a living, struggle to get by, and exist outside the professional-managerial class that dominates most literature.

## When to Use
- Writing characters who work manual, service, or low-wage jobs
- Capturing economic anxiety and material struggle authentically
- Giving voice to perspectives usually ignored or romanticized
- Avoiding condescension when writing about people unlike yourself
- Grounding narratives in physical labor and economic reality
- Creating dialogue that sounds like actual working people
- Writing about communities that aren't college-educated professionals



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Start from Material Reality

Working-class life is shaped by material conditions. Before anything else, know:
- What job does this person work? What are the specific physical demands?
- What do they earn? What can they actually afford?
- Where do they live? What's the commute?
- What's their relationship to health insurance, retirement, job security?
- What happens if they miss a day of work?

The body matters. The paycheck matters. Start there.

### Step 2: Write from Below, Not Above

Most literature looks down—even sympathetically—at working-class subjects. Flip the perspective:
- The character isn't failing to achieve middle-class success
- They're navigating their own world with its own values and victories
- Professional-class assumptions (career growth, self-actualization, work-life balance) may not apply
- The goal might be getting through, not getting ahead

### Step 3: Honor the Rhythm of Work

Working-class rhythm is different from creative-class rhythm:
- Time is structured around shifts, not projects
- Exhaustion is physical, not just mental
- Weekends and evenings have different weight
- The clock matters—punch in, punch out

Let this rhythm shape your prose. Sentences that punch like a time clock. Paragraphs like shifts endured.

### Step 4: Get the Details Right

Nothing destroys authenticity faster than wrong details:
- Know the actual job: tools, jargon, routines, hazards
- Know the economics: what things cost, what's a splurge, what's impossible
- Know the geography: where working-class people actually live in your setting
- Know the culture: what's valued, what's mocked, how people talk

Research isn't optional. If you haven't lived it, talk to people who have.

### Step 5: Avoid the Traps

**Don't romanticize:** Working-class people aren't noble savages with hearts of gold. They're people—complicated, sometimes mean, sometimes generous.

**Don't pathologize:** Poverty isn't a moral failing or a disease. Don't write characters who need saving.

**Don't explain:** Working-class characters shouldn't exist to teach middle-class readers lessons. Let them live their own lives.

**Don't sanitize:** Economic struggle is hard and ugly sometimes. Don't make it palatable for comfortable readers.

### Step 6: Find the Voice

Working-class voice tends toward:
- Plain language (not simple—plain)
- Concrete over abstract
- Doing over theorizing
- Skepticism toward authority and expertise
- Dark humor about hard situations
- Solidarity through shared struggle
- Pride in competence and endurance

## Examples of Application

### Example 1: Introducing a Character

**Middle-class lens:**
"Despite his limited education, Joe possessed a certain rough wisdom and worked hard to provide for his family."

**Working-class voice:**
"Joe had been on the line at the plant for eighteen years. He knew every sound the machines made—which rattle meant trouble, which whine you could ignore. The night shift paid an extra seventy-five cents an hour. That seventy-five cents was his daughter's braces."

### Example 2: Writing Dialogue

**Inauthentic:**
"I find myself questioning whether the American Dream is truly accessible to those of us in the working class."

**Authentic:**
"They keep saying work hard and you'll get ahead. Yeah? I've been working hard since I was sixteen. Where's ahead? I'm waiting."

### Example 3: Describing Economic Stress

**From outside:**
"The family struggled with financial difficulties, learning to appreciate what truly mattered."

**From inside:**
"The truck needed new brakes. The brakes cost four hundred dollars. They had two hundred. So they drove careful and hoped. That was the month. That was every month—the math that never added up, the choices between bad and worse."

### Example 4: Showing Work

**Abstract:**
"She found her job at the warehouse unfulfilling."

**Concrete:**
"Twelve hours picking orders, walking fifteen miles on concrete floors. The scanner beeped every time she grabbed something—a pace set by algorithm. Bathroom break meant falling behind. Falling behind meant a talk with the supervisor. She took home $589 a week after taxes. Her feet had stopped feeling like feet somewhere around year two."

## Key Principles

1. **Material first** - Money, bodies, and labor shape everything
2. **Specificity over sentiment** - Details, not feelings
3. **Below, not above** - Write from inside the experience, not looking down on it
4. **Work as real** - Labor is physical; show it
5. **No saviors needed** - Characters aren't problems to be solved
6. **Rhythm of shifts** - Let work structure time and prose
7. **Dark humor as survival** - Laughter at what can't be fixed

## Research Checklist

Before writing working-class characters, know:

- [ ] The specific job (duties, dangers, daily routine)
- [ ] The pay (hourly/salary, overtime rules, deductions)
- [ ] The benefits (or lack thereof)
- [ ] The commute (how do they get to work?)
- [ ] The housing (what can they actually afford?)
- [ ] The trade-offs (what do they sacrifice to get by?)
- [ ] The jargon (how do people in this job actually talk?)
- [ ] The culture (what's respected, what's mocked?)

## What This Skill Is NOT

- Poverty porn (exploiting suffering for drama)
- Slumming (temporary tourism in working-class life)
- Noble savage tropes (romanticizing the poor)
- Misery without agency (victims without humanity)
- Dialect condescension (mocking how people talk)

The goal is recognition. Working-class readers should see their own lives reflected with accuracy and respect. Non-working-class readers should see past their assumptions to shared humanity. Both should encounter people, not types.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.
